A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that creates a bridge between AI language models and the Trakt.tv API, allowing LLMs to access real-time entertainment data.

## ü§ñ What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open specification that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to interact with external systems and data sources. 

MCP creates a standardized way for AI models to:

- Access real-time data beyond their training cutoff date
- Connect to external APIs and web services through dedicated servers
- Execute specialized tools and functions securely
- Read from and write to external resources
- Process complex data that would be difficult to handle in text-only formats

At its core, MCP works by defining:

1. **Resources**: Structured data sources that an AI can read from or write to (like `trakt://shows/trending`)
2. **Tools**: Functions that the AI can invoke to perform specific actions (like `fetch_trending_shows`)
3. **Sessions**: Secure connections between the AI and MCP servers

MCP servers like this one act as bridges between AI models and the external world, allowing them to be extended with new capabilities without requiring retraining.

## üì∫ What is Trakt?

[Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) is a platform that automatically tracks what TV shows and movies you watch. The service offers:

- Comprehensive tracking of viewing habits across multiple streaming services
- Social features to share and discuss what you're watching with friends
- Personalized recommendations based on your viewing history
- Extensive APIs that developers can use to build applications

Trakt has become the standard for entertainment tracking with:
- Over 14 million users tracking their viewing habits
- Data on millions of movies and TV shows, including detailed metadata
- Integration with popular media players and streaming services

This MCP server taps into Trakt's rich API ecosystem to bring real-time entertainment data directly to your conversations with AI assistants like Claude.

## üöÄ The Cursor Development Experience

This entire project was developed using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), a code editor built for the AI era, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet generating all code. This approach demonstrates:

- How AI-assisted development can dramatically accelerate building specialized MCP servers
- The capabilities of modern AI in writing functional, well-structured code
- A collaborative workflow between human intent and AI implementation

## ‚ú® Features
